## Description
With the Note Taker application, users can write and save notes. The application provides an intuitive interface for organizing thoughts and keeping track of tasks. Taking notes is important because it improves retention, enhances active engagement with the material, and facilitates organization and structure. It serves as a personalized study aid, allowing for easier review, better understanding, and efficient recall of information when needed.

Note Taker is built using Express.js on the back end to handle routing and data storage. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end to provide a user-friendly interface.

Note Taker was created using [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka) from [Xander Rapstine](https://github.com/Xandromus), which contained contributions from <a href="https://github.com/nol166">John McCambridge</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Georgeyoo">Georgeyoo</a>.

You can access the deployed [here](https://mc-note-taker.herokuapp.com/) and the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/MCunha17/note-taker-app).
