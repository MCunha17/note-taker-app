## Description
With the Note Taker application, users can write and save notes. The application provides an intuitive interface for organizing thoughts and keeping track of tasks.

Note Taker is built using Express.js on the back end to handle routing and data storage. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end to provide a user-friendly interface.

Note Taker was created using [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka) from [Xander Rapstine](https://github.com/Xandromus), which contained contributions from <a href="https://github.com/nol166">John McCambridge</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Georgeyoo">Georgeyoo</a>.

You can access the deployed [here] (coming soon) and the GitHub repository [here] (https://github.com/MCunha17/note-taker-app).
